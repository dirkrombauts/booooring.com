Soundtrack for your meetings.

## Ideas, things I might add
- hit list, top 10 played sounds
- my favorites - store in cookie
- tags for sounds
-- show links to tag per sound
-- list all sounds per tag
- possibility to add picture per sound
- comments on the sound page, via disqus
- Button to copy URL for autoplay to clipboard (ZeroClipboard)

## Todo
- Superslick layout - buy from someone
- Ads on the page

## Doing
- buy booring.com
- configure booring.com to point to boooring.herokuapp.com
- More sounds:
-- Aaaah from Exalicbur
-- Doh!
-- Yes!
-- Noooooooooooooo
-- Hammarbyklacken

## Done
- show the number of plays each sound has been played
- store the number of plays per sound
- /sound/:name - show only that sound. Accept and autoplay parameter
- new layout so that more button fits
- move the data, except the sounds, to a database
- initial setup

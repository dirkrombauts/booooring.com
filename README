# What is it?
The soundtrack for your meetings.

# Kanban
## Ideas, things I might add
- hit list, top 10 played sounds
- my favorites - store in cookie
- search per tag
-- Add tags to the data model
- possibility to add picture

## Todo
- configure booring.com to point to boooring.herokuapp.com
- store the number of plays per sound
- show the number of plays each sound has been played
- More sounds:
-- Aaaah from Exalicbur
-- Doh!
-- Yes!
-- Noooooooooooooo
-- Hammarbyklacken

## Doing
- /sound/:name - show only that sound. Accept and autoplay parameter
- buy booring.com


## Done
- new layout so that more button fits
- move the data, except the sounds, to a database
- initial setup
- Google Analytics
